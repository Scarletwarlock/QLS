        <h2 id="chapter-one">Chapter One: Dreams & Troubles</h2>
        <p>Mom yelled at us as loud as she can because we went to a concert secretly at night. Honestly who would have thought that your mother will be staying in your room, roaming angrily, when you come to your room through the window with your brother after successfully sneaking out to a concert? (Of course, it is Sasha’s concert. How can I miss that?) Well, from now on, I will think that. Why was I dumb enough to trust Alex and go to that concert with him? Still, it seems strange that mom would know that we sneaked out. Someone must have told her. But who?</p>
        <p>I am Felix, the oldest sibling of the family and twin brother of Alex. I also have an annoying sister called Chloe. According to us, she is the most annoying sister ever.</p>
        <p>Next day (Day after filling my ears with mom’s very very sweet words), I’ve woke up really late. When I looked at the clock, I was stunned. It is 11:45 in the morning. I’m 03 hours and 15 minutes late for school. Guess I won’t go to school today. But I’ve never slept so long. I got up quickly. I looked at Alex’s bed. It looks like he got up quickly. Are you kidding? Trust me, the fact I got up late can be accepted. But If you say he got up early, you must’ve hit your head somewhere. But somehow it is true.</p>
        <p>Okay, no time to dream. I have to rush. “Mom…” She wasn’t the one replying when I called her. She must be at our neighbor Greens’. For your knowledge, when my mom and Mrs Green are together they won’t stop until their throats dry out. I don’t even know where they find that much gossips. Okay back to the story, since mom didn’t answer I called Dad. He didn’t reply either. Well, how can I forget that today is a Thursday? He must be in his office. Wait a minute, today is not a Thursday. It is Saturday. So Chloe and Alex must be home. I called Alex. He wasn’t the one to answer either. Since I have no other option left, I shouted “Chloe…”. I already knew she wasn’t going to answer. Okay, since you don’t answer, I am going to have a little search. I searched every corner of the house. Still no clue. Then I quickly went to my room (Even if I say my room here, this room is owned by both Alex and me.) Then I flipped through the calendar, only to know today is not April 1st.</p>
        <p>“Okay, you win. Now please come out.” I shouted again. Still, they didn’t come out. “Hmm, there really is something happening” I thought. Alex never leaves home without me and Chloe, the only thing she does is following us and spying on us. I took my phone. (It's the newest brand; iPhone 15 Pro) I called Mom’s, Dad’s, Alex’s, and Chloe’s numbers in alphabetical order. Well, they all rang. And the phones were home. Well, carrying the phone wherever we go is a tradition of our family. “Okay, don’t come out. I can stay all day waiting.” Nope, I couldn’t do that. Soon, my rage got better of me. I hit the door very hard & then opened it. I couldn’t believe my eyes. What is that?</p>
        <p>Soon, I discovered the question is not ‘What?’, it is ‘Who?’. Is there a mirror? Nah, it can’t be. Okay, Is that me … or Alex? Well, Alex looked the same as me. Even our parents can’t identify us distinctly. But yeah, he looks more like me. But he is more older than me (He looks like he is 30 years old). Maybe he is my older self. I’ve heard about seeing your older self in movies. Usually in movies, they just come to fix a mistake made by their past self. Oh no! Have I made a big mistake? A very very big one? Before I could think what the mistake is, I found myself staring at him. Well, maybe I was staring at him because of his awkward suit. He was wearing a red leather suit and a coat of golden color on it. Unlike me, he had golden hair. With hair matching the coat and his leather suit, he looked really really … handsome. I mean, I’m handsome too. But he was more handsome.</p>
        <p>Okay, back to the story, at a gust of wind, he found himself staring at me. It was really really awkward. I mean is he going to talk or should I? “I haven’t much time. You have to...” Even though he didn’t get a chance to complete his sentence, he finally broke the silence. “What the he…” I didn’t get a chance to complete the sentence either. He started to talk again.</p>
        <p>“You have to find them. And destroy them, no matter what. The only thing I can tell you is that you’ll find it under the …” Suddenly, I heard a girl yelling – no screaming – “Mom…” Of course, it was a dream. (not the screaming) I recognized the voice of the girl. It was Chloe. I woke up quickly. Even did not see that Alex’s bed was empty as I rushed towards where I heard the screaming. Screaming led me to Chloe’s room. When I was entering the room, Chloe crashed into me with tears all over her face. And she again started to run. Must be to find mom. When I saw who was in the room, I realized what happened.</p>
        <p>“Did you hit her Alex? Why?” I asked Alex. “Yeah, I did. Why? Are you going to do something? Huh?” he replied angrily. “Hey, calm down. We are brothers, remember?” Sure, he calmed down. “Hmm, I’m sorry. It’s just I really really hate her.” He replied. “Why? What happened? She is just a 17-year-old girl, remember?” I was eager to know what happened. “Well, you won’t think the same way about her as you did before when you hear this. She was the one who told mom that we sneaked out at night.” He replied. But I was shocked. “How did she…?” I didn’t complete the question to get answers. “Maybe she spied on us.” “How can you be so sure?” “I …” Alex tried to reply, but he became speechless when he saw mom staring at us.</p>
        <p>“I am so disappointed in you Fe …” When she was about to start her speech, Alex disturbed her. “I am Alex, not Felix. Don’t you even know my name? Huh? Why do I even have to call you my mother?” “Oh, young man you are in big trouble. Is that how talk to your mother after hitting your little sister? Huh? Wait till your father arrives home. I will tell him all about your …” But mom didn’t have a chance to finish this sentence either. “Oh, shut up! You only care about your dumb daughter. Have you ever come to see my football practice or Felix’s science projects? All you ever cared about was your dumb daughter’s chess. She doesn’t even win either.” Since the condition started to get warmer here, I excused myself to my room while Chloe also came with me.</p>
        <p>Even though Chloe loves making these kinds of situations, trust me, she doesn’t enjoy these situations. If you are a member of my family, then you will have to see such situations at least once per week. Even though Chloe is not good in her studies or chess, she is a master of trouble making. She really is a good troublemaker.</p>

         <h2 id="chapter-two">Chapter Two: Augustus Walker</h2>
        <p>I heard Alex calling my name, 'Felix, wake up.' Confused, I asked him where we were. It was then that I realized we were stranded on an island. Alex tried explaining what had happened, but I was lost in thought, trying to recollect how we ended up there.</p>
        <p>It all began with my grandfather's diary. Augustus Walker, my father's father, was born in England and migrated to America in 1998. He fell in love with Valentina Drake, and together they had a son and a daughter – our father, Jack, and his older sister, Rachel. He started a business that brought in huge profits, making him the second-richest person in the world in 2008. However, my grandfather gave up his business to go on a quest in search of some artifacts, leaving his family behind when my father was only five years old.</p>
        <p>My father often regaled my brother, sister, and me with a captivating tale. He spoke of a fateful night when our grandfather, under mysterious circumstances, entrusted his diary to our grandmother for safekeeping. That night marked his disappearance. My father revealed this secret our grandmother harbored until her final moments, succumbing to cancer.</p>
        <p>At the tender age of six, my siblings and I diligently combed every nook of our home in a fervent quest for the elusive diary. Despite our persistent efforts, the diary remained elusive, and eventually, we reluctantly abandoned hope of ever uncovering its secrets.</p>
        <p>But one day, last Monday to be exact, something we didn't expect happened. Alex became ill. "Everything we planned with Diana and Tom .... What about them?" "You should rest Alex. I will tell them. They will understand." Then I phoned Diana and Tom to explain the situation. Just as expected they understood the condition. Even though Alex suggested that I should continue what we planned with Diana and Tom, I strongly disagreed. It's either with him or never. But this wasn't the only unlucky thing that happened today.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening, Chloe and I came home tired after the six craziest hours of our lives. What we didn't expect happened. By then, Alex had recovered. When we approached the oldest thing in our house, our grandfather's clock, we heard a loud sound, and it began to fall on us. As I rushed to a safe area, I remembered my most valuable possession, my school bag. And for God's sake, Chloe was still there. I ran to where the old clock would fall in 0.64 seconds, grabbed Chloe's hand, and ran toward a much safer position, allowing me to see who had tampered with the clock and made it fall on us. "Thad" — that was a loud sound, and you may know what happened.</p>
        <p>I wish I could unsee the person I saw behind the clock. It was Alex. Did he try to kill us both? I'm sure he doesn't want to harm his precious twin brother. But Chloe, was she his target? It wouldn't be a surprise if she was. He really hates Chloe.</p>
        <p>"No, it isn't what you think. I just wanted to surprise you," Alex didn't get a chance to complete his confession “By killing us both?” Chloe asked angrily. And then she continued, "No, thank you. You are the worst brother ever." Then she ran to her and closed the door, making a sound louder than the old clock falling to the ground. I'm sure mom will have to buy another door. “I just wanted to scare you both by making a loud sound," Alex confessed. But I was furious that words flew out of my mouth, "When will you ever start to think? If I did not run and save Chloe, then mom will kill us both, and Chloe is right, you are not just the worst brother but the dumbest one too."</p>
        <p>Alex was speechless; I had never yelled at him before. But soon, I calmed down. "Bring two brooms," I finally broke the quietness. "Why?" Alex questioned me. "Because we have to clean this if we don't want to die at this age," I answered. When Alex left to get two brooms from the basement, Chloe shouted, "Make it three. After all, I was a part of this mess too." Both Alex and I were surprised by her words. This is the first time in her life she's taking responsibility.</p>
        <p>We knew that it would not take a long time to clean the mess when all three of us are together. But there was one major problem: how will Mom and Dad react to the sudden disappearance of their precious heritage, the grandfather clock? But we forgot all about it when I found some kind of old notebook in the wreckage. For God's sake, it was my grandfather's diary.</p>

        <h2 id="chapter-three">Chapter Three: Grandfather’s Diary</h2>
        <p>We couldn’t believe our eyes. We had finally found our grandfather’s diary, after years of searching. We wondered how it ended up inside the clock, and why our grandfather hid it there. We also wondered what secrets and mysteries it contained. We opened the diary and flipped through the pages. It was written in a code that we couldn’t understand. It looked like an ancient language but there were some pictures too ...</p>
